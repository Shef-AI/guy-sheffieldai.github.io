FLAME GPU (Flexible Large-scale Agent Modelling Environment for Graphics Processing Units) is a GPU accelerated simulator for domain independent complex systems simulations. FLAME GPU 2 is complete re-write of the existing library offering greater flexibility, an improved interface for agent scripting and better research software engineering, with CUDA/C++ and Python interfaces.
