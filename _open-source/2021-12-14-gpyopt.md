GPyOpt is a Python open-source library for Bayesian Optimization developed by the Machine Learning group of the University of Sheffield. It is based on GPy, a Python framework for Gaussian process modelling. Among other functionalities, with GPyOpt you can design experiments in parallel, use cost models and mix different types of variables in your designs.
